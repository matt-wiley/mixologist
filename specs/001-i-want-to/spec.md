# Feature Specification: Firefox Tab Audio Volume Control Extension

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a browser extension for firefox that would allow me to centrally control the volume of each tab with running audio."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Browser extension for tab-specific audio control
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Firefox users with multiple tabs playing audio
   ‚Üí Actions: Control volume per tab, view audio status, adjust levels
   ‚Üí Data: Tab audio states, volume levels, tab identification
   ‚Üí Constraints: Firefox extension API limitations
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User opens extension, sees tabs with audio, adjusts volumes
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Firefox user has multiple tabs open with different audio sources (YouTube videos, music streaming, video calls, etc.) and wants to manage the volume of each tab independently without switching between tabs or adjusting system volume. They open the extension popup to see all tabs currently playing audio and can adjust each tab's volume using individual controls.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** multiple Firefox tabs are playing audio, **When** user clicks the extension icon, **Then** extension shows a list of all tabs with active audio and their current volume levels
2. **Given** the extension popup is open showing audio tabs, **When** user adjusts a volume slider for a specific tab, **Then** that tab's audio volume changes immediately while other tabs remain unaffected
3. **Given** a tab stops playing audio, **When** user refreshes the extension popup, **Then** that tab is removed from the audio control list
4. **Given** a new tab starts playing audio, **When** user opens the extension popup, **Then** the new tab appears in the audio control list with default volume
5. **Given** user closes a tab that was playing audio, **When** extension popup is refreshed, **Then** the closed tab is automatically removed from the control list

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a tab is muted by Firefox's native tab muting feature?
- How does the extension handle tabs that briefly play audio (like notification sounds)?
- What occurs when Firefox is minimized or loses focus while audio is playing?
- How does the system behave when multiple audio sources play simultaneously in the same tab?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Extension MUST detect all Firefox tabs currently playing audio
- **FR-002**: Extension MUST display a list of tabs with active audio in the popup interface
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to adjust volume level for each individual tab independently
- **FR-004**: Extension MUST show tab title/URL and current volume level for each audio-playing tab
- **FR-005**: Volume changes MUST take effect immediately when user adjusts controls
- **FR-006**: Extension MUST automatically update the tab list when audio starts/stops in tabs
- **FR-007**: Extension MUST persist volume settings for tabs across browser sessions
- **FR-008**: Extension MUST handle tabs that switch between audio/no-audio states
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to mute/unmute individual tabs through the extension
- **FR-010**: Extension MUST work with any web-based audio source, with YouTube as the primary target for MVP
- **FR-011**: Extension MUST display tab favicon, title, audio icon (doubles as mute/unmute button), and volume meter for visual feedback
- **FR-012**: Extension MUST request only minimum permissions necessary for audio control functionality (least privilege principle)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Audio Tab**: Represents a Firefox tab currently playing audio, with attributes like tab ID, title, URL, volume level, mute status, and audio activity state
- **Volume Setting**: Configuration for each tab's audio level, including current volume percentage and mute state
- **Extension State**: Current status of all monitored tabs and their audio properties
